ðŸ“Š Project - Data Science Course (Coursera)

This repository contains my final project from the Data Science course on Coursera. The project was developed using Jupyterlite Notebook and includes fundamental data science exercises, covering concepts such as:

âœ… Languages â€‹â€‹and libraries for data science
âœ… Tools used in the area
âœ… Arithmetic expressions and mathematical operations
âœ… Unit conversion (minutes to hours)
âœ… Use of Markdown cells and code to organize and execute exercises

ðŸ”— The notebook is publicly available and can be accessed directly through GitHub.

ðŸ“¸ It also includes a screenshot to prove the execution of the project.
